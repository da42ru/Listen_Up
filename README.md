# Listen_Up

Prior research indicates that music engagement is related to listening context. As digitization reshapes context, novel forms of engagement emerge. The present study conceptualized and quantified music engagement in relation to the modern listening contexts through which it manifests. The ListenUp Questionnaire captured engagement styles across preferred listening activities and mediums. Furthermore, it embodied engagement through self-rated subscales of attentional, emotional, financial, and time investment as represented by a composite factor of Music Devotion. A textual analysis revealed themes of listening motivations and groupings of music use functions. Descriptive and inferential analyses demonstrated significantly higher Music Devotion when a medium was used for purposes of curation and catalog, as opposed to convenience. This implies that the functionality of a listening medium and the subsequent ways by which it is used might influence the listenerâ€™s devotion to music.
